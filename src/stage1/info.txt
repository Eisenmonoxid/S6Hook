stage1 loader:
needs to be completely ASCII, (allowed values: 32 - 127)
the main stage1 loader (asciiLoader.asm) is standard NULL-free asm
which is then encoded to ASCII using ALPHA2
this generated code expects its base address in eax.
this is accomplished by asciiPre.asm (strictly ASCII only)
the full stage1 loader is therefore:  { asciiPre.bin + alpha2 output }
